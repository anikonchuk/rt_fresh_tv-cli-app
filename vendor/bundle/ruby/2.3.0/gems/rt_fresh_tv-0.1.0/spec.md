# Specifications for the CLI Assessment

Specs:
- [x] Have a CLI for interfacing with the application- Users interface with the CLI, which displays the list of television shows and gives users the option of getting more information about those shows.
- [x] Pull data from an external source- Data is pulled from Rotten Tomatoes' Top TV Shows page (https://www.rottentomatoes.com/top-tv/), as well as individual show pages on the site. 
- [x] Implement both list and detail views- The initial view for the user is the list of television shows that are "Certified Fresh" on Rotten Tomatoes, along with their TomatoMeter score. Users can then choose an individual show from the list, and the CLI will display a synopsis of the show, the critical consensus about the show, and a link for more information about the show.
